Shipwright::Manual::UsingFlags - Using Flags

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Shipwright B<flags> are a method for having a single repository support
multiple variants of vessels.

Imagine you want to create a project which requires a database. There are
several database types you want to support in the same repository, while you'd
like each built vessel to only support one type. (Sometimes you have to choose
one because some dists will be confused if provided with more than one type;
e.g.  for RT, you have to supply the database type when running ./configure).

This is a task that you can use Shipwright flags to accomplish.

For example, say you want to support both mysql and postgresql, and you've
imported mysql, DBD::mysql, postgresql and DBD::Pg to the repository.

The next step is to mark dists with flags; let's use C<mysql> and
C<postgresql> for this example.

    $ shipwright flags -r ... --name mysql --set mysql
    $ shipwright flags -r ... --name cpan-DBD-mysql --set mysql
    $ shipwright flags -r ... --name postgresql --set postgresql
    $ shipwright flags -r ... --name cpan-DBD-Pg --set postgresql

B<Flags> data is stored in F<shipwright/flags.yml>

When building, you can then set C<--flags> to C<mysql> or C<postgresql> to
install support for that database only.

If a dist needs this info to configure (like RT for example), you'll need
to customize the build script; see L<Shipwright::Manual::CustomizeBuild> for
information about how to do this.

If no flags are specified during build, both mysql and postgresql would be
installed to the vessel. Which one RT chooses to configure for depends on its
build script.

Note:

Shipwright will automatically add C<default> to C<--flags>, and if a
dist has no flags set (i.e. it does not appear in F<shipwright/flags.yml>),
it will be given the C<default> flag and will be installed by default.
